**This template is intended to give everyone the same boilerplate sections to fill out when pitching ideas so that we can keep a repository from which we can all collaborate.  The template provides the intended purpose, instructions, and an example for each section.  This document is a living document and is open to modification to anyone via forking and pull request or by contacting anyone on the developer team for Dallas Society of Play.**

# The Game Title Goes Here

## Elevator Pitch
A one sentence description of the game.  Adding the hook into the description is a good idea.

*example:*
> **The Game Title Goes Here** is a 4 player arena game where each person plays a character in an environment with an objective.

## Design Goals
Enumerated list of experiences of goals that will drive design decisions.

*example:*

1. The game should let **action** be the main goal of every decision.  The only low points should be between players waiting for action to occur from event.

2. The game should be simple to understand and allow players to generate their own strategies instead of enforcing specific gameplay through rules.

## Details

Explain in detail all the game elements and design decisions in the game with explanation of why they support the design goals.

*example:*
#### Weapons
Everyone will have a oversized mallet and slingshot.  The slingshot will do minimal damage while the mallet will do maximum damage at close range.  This gives players an incentive to be in melee constantly leading to more action during play.

#### Environment
The entire environment will be a floor that will cause the player to fall through into lava below if the player stands still for longer than 2 seconds.  This gives player an incentive to keep moving leading to a more action during play.

The environment will also contain boost plates on the floor that can launch a player in the direction specified on the plate.  This gives players an opportunity to close gaps with opponents leading to more action during play.

## Gameplay

Explain in steps how the game will play out from start to finish.  This should be an general outline of play and not a detailed explanation of each aspect of the game.

*example:*

1. Players will have 30 seconds to hit a button to join the game before the game begins.

2. Players will be given a 3 second count before the game starts.  Players are unable to move from their pre designated spawn points until the game starts.

3. When the game starts, players will attempt to kill each other through attacks.

4. When there is one person left, that person is declared winner of the round.

5. All players will respawn and the round will start over with a new 3 second count.

6. When one player has won 3 games, that person is declared winner of the game.

7. A new game will begin through the same steps listed above.

## Controls

This section should identify the input mappings for the game.  There is an optional section if certain button combinations are used in the game.

*example:*
#### Joystick
The joystick will move the player in all directions in the game.

#### Button 1 (B1)
B1 will perform a melee attack in the direction the player is facing.

#### Button 2 (B2)
B2 will perform a ranged attack in the direction the player is facing.

#### Button 3 (B3)
B3 will perform a special attack based on player's character.

#### Button Combinations (optional)
Combination | Output
------------|--------
B1 + B2     | performs a melee attack that will knock the opponent backward and stun them for a short time
B1 + B3     | performs a extremely close range attack that will instakill an opponent
